1. What is this calculator capable of doing?

It is similar to the calculator application on your mobile devices, 
laptop and desktop excluding the functions of the scientific and programming calculator.

    c. Operators (numberkeys)


4. How do I use the memory functions?

There are currently no memory functions programmed in to the application.

5. How do I access the scientific functions?

There are no scientific functions as this was intended to mimic the applications on your mobile phone and desktop/laptop,
the purpose being a simple calculator.

6. Can I use this calculator on my mobile device?

No, as the program has to be ran through the terminal, 
your mobile devices will not be able to use this calculator application.

In the "Issues" tab, you could raise a new issue and I will be sure to check it out.

8. Are there any known issues or limitations with the calculator?

There are issues, but I am too much of a newbie to identify them myself.
I appreciate the help if anyone helps to point them out in the "issues" tab.

9. Why did I work on this project?

I wanted to test my Python programming abilities after the learning duration of 1 to 2 months.

10. Why does this project look similar to the projects online?

While working on the project, I made sure to constantly use online resources to ensure that I was on the right path of learning.
I want to make sure that the code I'm writing can be applied to real world standards.

11. How did I find the difficulty of the project?

I thought that it was moderate to tough in level but would have been easier to the intermediate/experience programmer.
